# MEAN-Stack Workshop @ jambit
==================

A trend in the development of modern web applications is full-stack JavaScript development via the MEAN Stack.
The acronym stands for:
(M)ongoDB – a NoSQL document datastore which uses JSON-style documents to represent data
(E)xpress – a HTTP server framework on top of Node
(A)ngular –  the JS framework offering declarative, two-way databinding for webapps
(N)ode – the platform built on V8’s runtime for easily building fast, scalable network applications

In the workshop we will build a simple web application, incl. frontend and backend with persistence, from scratch and attempt to demonstrate why supporters of the stack claim increased productivity.
